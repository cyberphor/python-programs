### Challenge 09
Someone wanted to play a joke on the incoming scholars on their first day at Bakery Square. Rather than just give them the floor number that the office is on, this person wrote instructions describing the absolute worst way to get here. The wild goose chase is structured as follows. There are only two types of directions in the instructions, up which is noted as ^ and down noted as v. Write a program that will read through the directions, however long they might be, and tell the poor scholars what floor they are supposed to end up on to get to the office.

**Assumptions** 
- The scholars all start on floor 0
- The building has infinitely many basement levels so they can travel as far down as the instructions tell them.
- The building has infinitely many stories so they can travel as far up as they are instructed.

**Sanity Checks**
- `v^v^v^v^` should result in floor 0
- `vv^^^^` should result in floor 2
- `^^vvvv` should result in floor -2
- `^^VA0vvvv` should result in floor -2
